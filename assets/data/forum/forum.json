An enum in .NET is a structure that maps a set of values (fields) to a basic type (the default is int). However, you can actually choose the integral type that your enum maps to: public enum Foo : short. In this case the enum is mapped to the short data type, which means it will be stored in memory as a short and will behave as a short when you cast and use it.",

For most cases, in mono-lingual, English code bases this answer will suffice. I'm suspecting because most people coming here fall in this category this is the most popular answer. This answer however brings up the inherent problem that we can't compare text case insensitive until we know both texts are the same culture and we know what that culture is.

That sort of pattern is kind of useless in Kotlin though, one of its strengths is that it gets rid of the need for classes filled with static methods. It is more appropriate to utilize global, extension and/or local functions instead, depending on your use case. Where I work we often define global extension functions in a separate, flat file with the naming convention: [className]Extensions.kt i.e., FooExtensions.kt.
